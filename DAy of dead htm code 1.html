        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a celebration of life. Surprised? Don’t worry! We’ll tell you everything you’ll need to know to celebrate the Day of the Dead like a local, starting with: what is it exactly?</p>
        <p>The three-day festivity, starting October 31 and finishing November 2, is a annual Mexican holiday that celebrates the reunion of deceased loved ones with their friends and families. The celebration is believed to help the souls of loved ones on their spiritual journey to the afterlife.</p>
        <p>One of the most prominent traditions involves building altars called ofrendas in honor of the deceased. Families will visit the graves of loved ones, tidying and decorating sites with candles, trinkets, cempazúchitl (marigolds; also known as “the flower of the dead”), colorfully painted skeletons and the deceased’s favorite candies and beverages, including atole and mezcal.</p>

        <h1>Observance in Mexico</h1>
        <h3>Altars and installations in Mexico City museums and public spaces</h3>
        <p>A number of Mexico City's museums and public spaces have played an important part in developing and promoting urban Day of the Dead traditions through altars and installations. These notable organizations include: Anahuacalli, The Frida Kahlo Museum, The Museum of Popular Cultures, The Dolores Olmedo Museum, The Museum of the First Printing Press, and The Cloister of Sor Juana. From turn of the millennium until the imposition of the James Bond-inspired parade, remarkable large-scale installations were created on the Zocalo, Mexico City's central square
        
        </p>
        <h3>Altars (ofrendas)</h3>

        <p>During Día de Muertos, the tradition is to build private altars ("ofrendas") containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the words of the living directed to them. These altars are often placed at home or in public spaces such as schools and libraries, but it is also common for people to go to cemeteries to place these altars next to the tombs of the departed.</p>

        <p class="small">Mexican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagetes_erecta">cempasúchil</a> (marigold) is the traditional flower used to honor the dead.</p>
        <p class="right">Plans for the day are made throughout the year, including gathering the goods to be offered to the dead. During the three-day period families usually clean and decorate graves;[23] most visit the cemeteries where their loved ones are buried and decorate their graves with ofrendas (altars), which often include orange Mexican marigolds (Tagetes erecta) called cempasúchil (originally named cempōhualxōchitl, Nāhuatl for 'twenty flowers'). In modern Mexico the marigold is sometimes called Flor de Muerto ('Flower of Dead'). These flowers are thought to attract souls of the dead to the offerings. It is also believed the bright petals with a strong scent can guide the souls from cemeteries to their family homes.Toys are brought for dead children (los angelitos, or 'the little angels'), and bottles of tequila, mezcal or pulque or jars of atole for adults. Families will also offer trinkets or the deceased's favorite candies on the grave. Some families have ofrendas in homes, usually with foods such as candied pumpkin, pan de muerto ('bread of dead'), and sugar skulls; and beverages such as atole. The ofrendas are left out in the homes as a welcoming gesture for the deceased. Some people believe the spirits of the dead eat the "spiritual essence" of the ofrendas' food, so though the celebrators eat the food after the festivities, they believe it lacks nutritional value. Pillows and blankets are left out so the deceased can rest after their long journey. In some parts of Mexico, such as the towns of Mixquic, Pátzcuaro and Janitzio, people spend all night beside the graves of their relatives. In many places, people have picnics at the grave site, as well.</p>
        <p class="right">Some families build altars or small shrines in their homes;[23] these sometimes feature a Christian cross, statues or pictures of the Blessed Virgin Mary, pictures of deceased relatives and other people, scores of candles, and an ofrenda. Traditionally, families spend some time around the altar, praying and telling anecdotes about the deceased. In some locations, celebrants wear shells on their clothing, so when they dance, the noise will wake up the dead; some will also dress up as the deceased.</p>

        <h3>Food</h3>

        <p>During Day of the Dead festivities, food is both eaten by living people and given to the spirits of their departed ancestors as ofrendas ('offerings').[26] Tamales are one of the most common dishes prepared for this day for both purposes.[27]</p>
       
        <p class="right">Pan de muerto and calaveras are associated specifically with Day of the Dead. Pan de muerto is a type of sweet roll shaped like a bun, topped with sugar, and often decorated with bone-shaped pieces of the same pastry.[28] Calaveras, or sugar skulls, display colorful designs to represent the vitality and individual personality of the departed.[27]</p>
        <p class="right">In addition to food, drinks are also important to the tradition of Day of the Dead. Historically, the main alcoholic drink was pulque; today families will commonly drink the favorite beverage of their deceased ancestors.[27] Other drinks associated with the holiday are atole and champurrado, warm, thick, non-alcoholic masa drinks.</p>
        <p class="right">Agua de Jamaica (water of hibiscus) is a popular herbal tea made of the flowers and leaves of the Jamaican hibiscus plant (Hibiscus sabdariffa), known as flor de Jamaica in Mexico. It is served cold and quite sweet with a lot of ice. The ruby-red beverage is also known as hibiscus tea in English-speaking countries.[29]</p>
        <p class="right">In the Yucatán Peninsula, mukbil pollo (píib chicken) is traditionally prepared on October 31 or November 1, and eaten by the family throughout the following days. It is similar to a big tamale, composed of masa and pork lard, and stuffed with pork, chicken, tomato, garlic, peppers, onions, epazote, achiote, and spices. Once stuffed, the mukbil pollo is bathed in kool sauce, made with meat broth, habanero chili, and corn masa. It is then covered in banana leaves and steamed in an underground oven over the course of several hours. Once cooked, it is dug up and opened to eat.[30][31]</p>

        <h3>Calaveras</h3>

        <p class="right">A common symbol of the holiday is the skull (in Spanish calavera), which celebrants represent in masks, called calacas (colloquial term for skeleton), and foods such as chocolate or sugar skulls, which are inscribed with the name of the recipient on the forehead. Sugar skulls can be given as gifts to both the living and the dead.[32] Other holiday foods include pan de muerto, a sweet egg bread made in various shapes from plain rounds to skulls, often decorated with white frosting to look like twisted bones.[25]</p>

        <h3>Calaverita</h3>

        <p class="right">In some parts of the country, especially the larger cities, children in costumes roam the streets, knocking on people's doors for a calaverita, a small gift of candies or money; they also ask passersby for it. This custom is similar to that of Halloween's trick-or-treating in the United States, but without the component of mischief to homeowners if no treat is given.[33]</p>

        <h3>Calaveras literarias</h3>

        <p class="right">A distinctive literary form exists within this holiday where people write short poems in traditional rhyming verse, called calaveras literarias (lit. "literary skulls"), which are mocking, light-hearted epitaphs mostly dedicated to friends, classmates, co-workers, or family members (living or dead) but also to public or historical figures, describing interesting habits and attitudes, as well as comedic or absurd anecdotes that use death-related imagery which includes but is not limited to cemeteries, skulls, or the grim reaper, all of this in situations where the dedicatee has an encounter with death itself.[34][35] This custom originated in the 18th or 19th century after a newspaper published a poem narrating a dream of a cemetery in the future which included the words "and all of us were dead", and then proceeding to read the tombstones. Current newspapers dedicate calaveras literarias to public figures, with cartoons of skeletons in the style of the famous calaveras of José Guadalupe Posada, a Mexican illustrator.[32] In modern Mexico, calaveras literarias are a staple of the holiday in many institutions and organizations, for example, in public schools, students are encouraged or required to write them as part of the language class.[10]</p>

        <p class="right">Posada's most famous print, La Calavera Catrina ("The Elegant Skull"), was likely intended as a criticism of Mexican upper-class women who imitated European fashions. It was first published posthumously in a broadside with a text (not by Posada) that mocked working-class vendors of chickpeas.[36]</p>

        <p class="right">Posada's image of a skeletal figure with a big hat decorated with two ostrich feathers and flowers was elaborated into a full scale figure by Mexican Muralist Diego Rivera in a fresco painted in 1946–47. Rivera's Catrina has a simple Tehuana dress and a feather boa, as well as other features that make allusions to the indigenous peoples of Mexico. Through the addition of these indigenous features, Rivera rehabilitated Catrina into a nationalist emblem.[36]</p>

        <p class="right">The Catrina character has become deeply associated with the Day of the Dead. Catrina figures made of a wide range of materials, as well as people with Catrina costumes, have come to play a prominent role in modern Day of the Dead observances in Mexico and elsewhere. The Catrina phenomenon has in fact gone beyond Day of the Dead, resulting in non-seasonal and even permanent "Catrinas", including COVID-19 masks, tattoos, permanently decorated cars, and Catrina-themed artworks. Some artists have even developed a sub-specialization in Catrina imagery.[39]</p>

        <h1>Observances outside of Mexico</h1>

        <h2>America</h2>

        <h3>United States</h3>

        <p class="right">In many U.S. communities with Mexican residents, Day of the Dead celebrations are very similar to those held in Mexico. In some of these communities, in states such as Texas,[44] New Mexico,[45] and Arizona,[46] the celebrations tend to be mostly traditional. The All Souls Procession has been an annual event since 1990 in Tucson, Arizona. The event combines elements of traditional Day of the Dead celebrations with those of pagan harvest festivals. People wearing masks carry signs honoring the dead and an urn in which people can place slips of paper with prayers on them to be burned.[47] Likewise, Old Town San Diego, California, annually hosts a traditional two-day celebration culminating in a candlelight procession to the historic El Campo Santo Cemetery.[48]</p>

        <p class="right">The festival also was held annually at historic Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Sponsored by Forest Hills Educational Trust and the folkloric performance group La Piñata, the Day of the Dead festivities celebrated the cycle of life and death. People brought offerings of flowers, photos, mementos, and food for their departed loved ones, which they placed at an elaborately and colorfully decorated altar. A program of traditional music and dance also accompanied the community event. The Jamaica Plain celebration was discontinued in 2011.[49]</p>

        <p class="right">The Smithsonian Institution, in collaboration with the University of Texas at El Paso and Second Life, have created a Smithsonian Latino Virtual Museum and accompanying multimedia e-book: Día de los Muertos: Day of the Dead. The project's website contains some of the text and images which explain the origins of some of the customary core practices related to the Day of the Dead, such as the background beliefs and the offrenda (the special altar commemorating one's deceased loved one).[50] The Made For iTunes multimedia e-book version provides additional content, such as further details; additional photo galleries; pop-up profiles of influential Latino artists and cultural figures over the decades; and video clips[51] of interviews with artists who make Día de Muertos-themed artwork, explanations and performances of Aztec and other traditional dances, an animation short that explains the customs to children, virtual poetry readings in English and Spanish.[52][53]</p>

        <p class="right">In 2021, the Biden-Harris administration celebrated the Día de Muertos.[54]</p>

        <h3>California</h3>

        <p class="right">Santa Ana, California, is said to hold the "largest event in Southern California" honoring Día de Muertos, called the annual Noche de Altares, which began in 2002.[55] The celebration of the Day of the Dead in Santa Ana has grown to two large events with the creation of an event held at the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center for the first time on November 1, 2015.[56]</p>

        <p class="right">In other communities, interactions between Mexican traditions and American culture are resulting in celebrations in which Mexican traditions are being extended to make artistic or sometimes political statements. For example, in Los Angeles, California, the Self Help Graphics & Art Mexican-American cultural center presents an annual Day of the Dead celebration that includes both traditional and political elements, such as altars to honor the victims of the Iraq War, highlighting the high casualty rate among Latino soldiers. An updated, intercultural version of the Day of the Dead is also evolving at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.[57] There, in a mixture of Native Californian art, Mexican traditions and Hollywood hip, conventional altars are set up side by side with altars to Jayne Mansfield and Johnny Ramone. Colorful native dancers and music intermix with performance artists, while sly pranksters play on traditional themes.</p>

        <p class="right">Similar traditional and intercultural updating of Mexican celebrations are held in San Francisco. For example, the Galería de la Raza, SomArts Cultural Center, Mission Cultural Center, de Young Museum and altars at Garfield Square by the Marigold Project.[58] Oakland is home to Corazon Del Pueblo in the Fruitvale district. Corazon Del Pueblo has a shop offering handcrafted Mexican gifts and a museum devoted to Day of the Dead artifacts. Also, the Fruitvale district in Oakland serves as the hub of the Día de Muertos annual festival which occurs the last weekend of October. Here, a mix of several Mexican traditions come together with traditional Aztec dancers, regional Mexican music, and other Mexican artisans to celebrate the day.[59]</p>

        <p class="right">In San Diego, California, the city that borders Mexico, the celebrations range across the entire county. All the way up at the most northern part of the county, Oceanside celebrates their annual event which includes community and family altars built around the Oceanside Civic Center and Pier View Way, as well as events at the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. In the more central area of San Diego, City Heights celebrates through a public festival in Jeremy Henwood Memorial Park that includes at least 35 altars, lowriders, and entertainment, all for free. Down in Chula Vista, they celebrate the tradition through a movie night at Third and Davidson streets where they will be screening "Coco." This movie night also consists of a community altar, an Altar contest, a catrin/catrina contest, as well as lots of music, food, and vendors. Overall, San Diego is booming with colorful celebrations honoring ancestors across the county.[60]</p>

        <h2>Italy</h2>

        <p class="right">In Italy, November 2 is All Souls' Day and is colloquially known as Day of the Dead or "Giorno dei Morti". While many regional nuances exist, celebrations generally consist of placing flowers at cemeteries and family burial sites and speaking to deceased relatives.[61] Some traditions also include lighting a red candle or "lumino" on the window sills at sunset and laying out a table of food for deceased relatives who will come to visit. Like other Day of the Dead traditions around the world, Giorno dei Morti is a day dedicated to honoring the lives of those who have died. Additionally, it is a tradition that teaches children not to be afraid of death.</p>

        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/8f2c87f3-06e3-4463-9c73-9dbbb4b7698a/U_cannistru.jpg?v=1699108346049" alt="A Sicilian cannistru dei mort">

        <p class="small">A Sicilian cannistru dei mort</p>

        <p class="right">In Sicily, families celebrate a long-held Day of the Dead tradition called The Festival of the Dead or "Festa dei Morti". On the eve of November 1, La Festa di Ognissanti, or All Saints' Day, older family members act as the "defunti", or spirits of deceased family members, who sneak into the home and hide sweets and gifts for their young descendants to awake to. On the morning of November 2, children begin the day by hunting to find the gifts in shoes or a special wicker basket of the dead called "cannistru dei morti" or "u cannistru", which typically consist of various sweets, small toys, boned-shaped almond flavored cookies called "ossa dei morti", sugar dolls called "pupi di zucchero", and fruit, vegetable, and ghoul shaped marzipan treats called "Frutta martorana". The pupi di zucchero, thought to be an Arabic cultural import, are often found in the shapes of folkloric characters who represent humanized versions of the souls of the dead. Eating the sugar dolls reflects the idea of the individual absorbing the dead and, in doing so, bringing the dead back to life within themselves on November 2. After gifts are shared and breakfast is enjoyed, the whole family will often visit the cemetery or burial site bearing flowers. They will light candles and play amongst the graves to thank the deceased for the gifts, before enjoying a hearty feast. The tradition holds that the spirits of  he deceased will remain with the family to enjoy a day of feasting and merriment.[62]</p>
        <p class="right">Acclaimed Sicilian author Andrea Camilleri recounts his Giorno dei Morti experience as boy, as well as the negative cultural impact that WWII era American influence had on the long-held tradition.</p>
        <p class="right">"Every Sicilian house where there was a little boy was populated with dead familiar to him. Not ghosts with white linzòlo and with the scrunch of chains, mind you, not those that are frightening, but such and as they were seen in the photographs exhibited in the living room, worn, the occasional half smile printed on the face, the good ironed dress in a workmanlike manner, they made no difference with the living. We Nicareddri, before going to bed, put a wicker basket under the bed (the size varied according to the money there was in the family) that at night the dear dead would fill with sweets and gifts that we would find on the 2nd morning upon awakening. After a restless sleep we woke up at dawn to go hunting… Because the dead wanted to play with us, to give us fun, and therefore they didn't put the basket back where they had found it, but went to hide it carefully, we had to look for it… The toys were tin trains, wooden toy cars, rag dolls, wooden cubes that formed landscapes… On November 2nd we returned the visit that the dead had paid us the day before: it was not a ritual, but an affectionate custom. Then, in 1943, with the American soldiers the Christmas tree arrived and slowly, year after year, the dead lost their way to the houses where they were waiting for them, happy and awake until the end, the children or the children of the children… Pity. We had lost the possibility of touching, materially, that thread that binds our personal history to that of those who had preceded us…"</p>

        <p>— Andrea Camilleri, English translation of "The Day That The Dead Lost Their Way Home"[63]</p>

        <p class="right">Food plays an important part of Italy's day of the dead tradition, with various regional treats being used as offerings to the dead on their journey to the afterlife. In Tuscany and Milan the "pane dei morti" or "bread of the dead" is said to be the characteristic offering. In northern Apulia, a wheat growing region, a sweet dish for the Day of the Dead is Colva or "Grains of the Dead". Fave dei morti or "fava beans of the dead" are another dish for the day found widespread through Italy. Ossa dei morti, suitably elongated and frosted "bones of the dead" are sweets found in Apulia and Sicily. In Sicily, families enjoy special day of the dead cakes and cookies that are made into symbolic shapes such as skulls and finger bones. The "sweets of the dead" are a marzipan treats called frutta martorana.[64] On the night of November 1, Sicilian parents and grandparents traditionally buy Frutta di Martorana to gift to children on November 2.</p>

        <h1>Observance in France</h1>

        <p class="right">All Saints’ Day in France marks a school and work break halfway between Summer and Christmas. For the French Catholics, “la Toussaint” is a time to honour the dead—a time to visit cemeteries and put flowers on the graves. However, for others, the end of October is associated with Halloween. The French way bien sûr!</p>

        <p class="right">French people commemorate the dead in Autumn on the 1st of November. The date is a public holiday.</p>

        <h2>All Saints’ Day or All Souls’ Day?</h2>

        <h3>In addition, the catholic tradition makes a distinction between:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>la Toussaint (All Saints’ Day, on the 1st of November) and</li>
            <li>la Commémoration des fidèles défunts (All Souls’ Day, on the 2nd of November).</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="right">Dead relatives are supposed to be commemorated on the 2nd of November. But since Toussaint is a public holiday, French people honour the dead on the 1st of November.</p>

        <p class="right">Members of a family usually gather to go to the cemetery together. Family members decorate the grave with potted:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>heather (bruyère),</li>
            <li>chrysanthemum (chrysanthèmes) and/or</li>
            <li>immortal wreaths (couronnes d’immortelles – everlasting flowers)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="right">Sometimes, they light candles to symbolise happiness in the afterlife. They can also attend special church services: the All Saints Mass (Messe de la Toussaint).</p>

        <h3>The opportunity of a family reunion</h3>

        <p class="right">Toussaint can be a significant moment for families. For instance, they can spend a day together in a respectful atmosphere. It is a time which generally excludes usual family fights… even though regrets and sorrow can be a source of tension.</p>

        <p class="right">To sum up, Toussaint is an opportunity to strengthen family links by spending a nice day together or expressing common grief.</p>

        <h3>The Origins of Toussaint in France</h3>

        <p class="right">For a long time, Toussaint was celebrated after the Easter celebrations or after Pentecost.</p>

        <p class="right">From 610AD, Pope Boniface IV made the 13th of May a day consecrated to the memory of the Christian martyrs.</p>

        <p class="right">The 1st of November was Samhain (later known as the “Celtic New Year”). The pagan day started a week of festivities in honour of the beginning of the year and the dark season.</p>

        <p class="right">Pope Gregory III may well be at the origin of the first Toussaint celebration falling on the 1st of November. However, Pope Gregory IV ordered in 835 that all Christians celebrate Toussaint on the 1st of November. In France, Carolingian Emperor Louis the Pious relayed Gregory IV’s decision.</p>

        <h2>All Saints Day and potato harvest!</h2>

        <p class="right">The Toussaint period used to be the same as the potato harvest time. All the family was working in the fields. This implied that the children were massively missing classes.</p>

        <p class="right">Consequently, “potato holidays” were organised. They lasted two weeks, usually between the 22nd of October and the 3rd of November. They later became the Toussaint holidays. A school break that is still enjoyed by French pupils today!</p>

        <h2>What about Halloween in France?</h2>

        <img class="Franceyep" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/8f2c87f3-06e3-4463-9c73-9dbbb4b7698a/Catacombes-de-Paris-13-copyright-French-Moments-1.jpg?v=1699705656607">

        <p class="right">Halloween night occurs between the 31st of October and Toussaint’s day.</p>

        <p class="right">Halloween is the contraction of “All Hallows Eve”. However, the customs originate from Samhain.</p>

        <p class="right">The pagan religious festival originates from Ireland. It refers to the legend of Jack O’Lantern, a greedy drunkard who cheated the Devil twice. After his death, his soul could not enter Heaven or Hell. He convinced the Devil to give him an ember, which he put in a hollowed-out turnip. It provided light for himself in his eternal wandering.</p>

        <h2>Is Halloween celebrated in France today?</h2>

        <p class="right">In France, Halloween spread very slowly until the 1990s. That decade saw a growing interest in celebrating Halloween. There are many reasons to explain this, such as:</p>

        <ul class="right">
            <li>The famous “Olaween” advertising campaign of the telephone company Orange,</li>
            <li>A few specific events in Disneyland Paris,</li>
            <li>Other commercial initiatives made the American celebration famous in France.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="right">Therefore, Halloween was rejected by those who called it a folkloric marketing operation.</p>

        <img class="Franceyep" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/8f2c87f3-06e3-4463-9c73-9dbbb4b7698a/Hans-Trapp-%C2%A9-French-Moments.jpg?v=1699706230754">

        <h2>French-style Halloween: a trashy and gruesome celebration?</h2>

        <p class="right">In France, Halloween presents a trashy and bloody dimension that differs from the original American version. The celebration is particularly animated by an atmosphere of fear and provocation. In other words, French Halloween uses hideousness, gruesomeness, and witchcraft.</p>

        <p class="right">Therefore, the youth adopted it rapidly for its taste in paranormal and witchcraft, role-plays, and “Gothic” fashion. Some people see it as a macabre version of the carnival!</p>

        <p class="right">Unsurprisingly, several French religious leaders opposed this new version of Halloween. Above all, they despised it for encouraging a culture of death. The religious authorities question the normalisation of the occult world on children… at a time when the focus should be on Toussaint!</p>

        <p class="right">The reaction of Paris’ diocese was an interesting one. For instance, the religious authorities organised a rival event – a play on words: “Holy Wins”.</p>

        <h2>Des bonbon ou des farces?</h2>

        <p class="right">Nevertheless, around 2000, costumes and decorations filled the shops: ghosts, skeletons, witches, Frankenstein monsters, vampires or mummies…</p>

        <p class="right">Candy sales increased by 30%.</p>

        <p class="right">Children dressed in gory Halloween costumes put into action a French adaptation of the American trick or treat: “des bonbons ou des farces” (candies or pranks).</p>
