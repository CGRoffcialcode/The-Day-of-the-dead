        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a celebration of life. Surprised? Don’t worry! We’ll tell you everything you’ll need to know to celebrate the Day of the Dead like a local, starting with: what is it exactly?</p>
        <p>The three-day festivity, starting October 31 and finishing November 2, is a annual Mexican holiday that celebrates the reunion of deceased loved ones with their friends and families. The celebration is believed to help the souls of loved ones on their spiritual journey to the afterlife.</p>
        <p>One of the most prominent traditions involves building altars called ofrendas in honor of the deceased. Families will visit the graves of loved ones, tidying and decorating sites with candles, trinkets, cempazúchitl (marigolds; also known as “the flower of the dead”), colorfully painted skeletons and the deceased’s favorite candies and beverages, including atole and mezcal.</p>

        <h2>Observance in Mexico</h2>
        <h3>Altars and installations in Mexico City museums and public spaces</h3>
        <p>A number of Mexico City's museums and public spaces have played an important part in developing and promoting urban Day of the Dead traditions through altars and installations. These notable organizations include: Anahuacalli, The Frida Kahlo Museum, The Museum of Popular Cultures, The Dolores Olmedo Museum, The Museum of the First Printing Press, and The Cloister of Sor Juana. From turn of the millennium until the imposition of the James Bond-inspired parade, remarkable large-scale installations were created on the Zocalo, Mexico City's central square

        <h3>Altars (ofrendas)</h3>

        <p>During Día de Muertos, the tradition is to build private altars ("ofrendas") containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls will hear the prayers and the words of the living directed to them. These altars are often placed at home or in public spaces such as schools and libraries, but it is also common for people to go to cemeteries to place these altars next to the tombs of the departed.</p>
